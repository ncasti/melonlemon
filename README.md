Things to make this even better: check if input has only spaces, or spaces before and after the word. This could be done with regular expressions or with a for loop. Additionally, program could use an API that checks whether submitted words actually exist. This would involve creating arrays of words separated by spaces, which was done in Essay Extender. The input could also accept symbols like punctuation and exclamation marks and simply ignore them.

The  if/else statments check: (1) if inputs are empty; (2) if inputs are the same to begin with; (3) if non-alphabetic characters other than the space are submitted; (4) if inputs are anagrams; (5) if they're not.
